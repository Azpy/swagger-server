Swagger Server Samples
============================
#### Fully-functional mock REST APIs that run in Swagger Server

|__v1.0.0 Beta Notice !__
|---------------------------------
| Swagger Server v1.0.0 is still in beta, and we're still working on the samples, documentation, and walkthroughs.  The v1.0 API isn't totally solidified yet, so the samples may still change.


#### Sample 1
This sample demonstrates the most simplistic usage of Swagger Server. It simply loads the [PetStore.yaml](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-server/blob/master/samples/sample1/PetStore.yaml) file and starts the server.  There's no custom code at all.

* [Walkthrough](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/docs/samples/running.md)


#### Sample 2
This sample demonstrates a few more advanced features, such as setting a few options, loading mock data, and adding custom middleware logic.

* [Source Code](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-server/blob/master/samples/sample2/server.js)
* [Walkthrough](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/docs/samples/walkthrough2.md)


#### Sample 3
This sample demonstrates Swagger Server's automatic module loading, as well as more advanced custom middleware logic.
